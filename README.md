I did not make this addon, I only fixed it for Turtle WOW https://turtle-wow.org/
# CooldownHud

Alpha transparent buttons showing cooldown of spells during combat closer to the center of the screen (where the action is)
Author: Marc aka Saien on Hyjal

 
 During combat will show icons above your chat window 
 (slightly transparent) showing the icons for spells 
 currently awaiting cooldown. Disappears entirely when 
 combat ends. Less watching the actionbar, and is closer 
 to the action on the screen.
 
 Type /hud for all available options
